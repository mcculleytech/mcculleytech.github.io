<p>In my recent post about <a href="/posts/asm101/">assembly</a>, I mentioned a desire to continue to grow in my understanding of low level programming. As a part of that I took a course on basic malware analysis from Mandiant that me both analyze malware samples both statically and dynamically. During that course I used <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro">IDA Pro</a> to decompile some malware and get a look &lsquo;under the hood&rsquo; so to speak at what a particular piece of malware was doing. The preexisting assembly knowledge was great to have for that section of the course. I also took the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/python-201-for-hackers">Python 201</a> from TCM where the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> was used to interact with the Win32 API to see if I could use my existing python knowledge to interact with Windows at a low level. I decided it&rsquo;d be a good exercise to meld these two trainings together into a personal project/ exercise and write a piece of malware in Python (I use the term malware loosely), and then analyze it using some of the tools and techniques that I learned in the Mandiant training. Thus this post was born.</p>
<p>As a brief side note - my subnet changed a few times in my local VMWare network so if you notice different IPs that&rsquo;s the reason why. There&rsquo;s a small chance that I mix up screenshots between the different subnets by accident.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">methodology<a href="#methodology" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>For the purposes of this project I wanted something simple since I&rsquo;m a little out of my element in malware development (it&rsquo;s a work in progress). I decided to write a piece of malware that opens up notepad, allocates memory within that process, writes some shellcode, then executes it. As I stated in the overview, this will be done in python and utilizing the <code>ctypes</code> library. The execution will be done on a <a href="https://github.com/mandiant/commando-vm">commando vm</a> which comes with some analysis tools.</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-malware">writing the &lsquo;malware&rsquo;<a href="#writing-the-malware" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>The malware writing process involved me taking a deeper dive and reviewing one of the projects outlined in the Python 201 course by TCM where the malware written follows the same flow that I wanted to analyze. To be honest the only real difference is in the shellcode. The msfvenom payload was crafted to make a callback to my attacker machine.</p>
<p>[Insert Screenshots and source code link here]</p>
<p>As a final step in this exercise - I want to format the malware into an exe to run against my commando vm. Obviously having Python on a Windows machine is non standard so I&rsquo;d like for it to be more portable and mimic a more &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; piece of malware in format.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-analysis">dynamic analysis<a href="#dynamic-analysis" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important before running the malware in our sandbox environment to take a snapshot of the VM we&rsquo;re running it on. That way any artifacts left behind are wiped away once we restore the VM to it&rsquo;s old snapshot. Once that&rsquo;s done, we need to setup a few tools to capture the behavior of the malware. <a href="">FakeNet</a> is a tool built by Mandiant that will allow us to fake network activity.</p>
